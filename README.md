# ExDeath_Scraper
Flexible C# Scraping Application w/ GUI. The intention is to create a scraping application that is easily tailored to whatever freelance project I'm currently working on.

## Features
* GUI
* Bing scraper
* Async crawler w/ queue

Still in the alpha stage of development, do not attempt to use this unless you feel like hooking all the stuff up before you start crawling.

# Todo

### Short Term
* csv and xlsx handling.
* Abstract the Regex scraper into the crawler class.
* Implement url classifier

### Long Term
* Create a priority queue based on the url classification model
* Finish implementing linkedin scraper.
* Element picker functionality.
